## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret data. This project focuses on the LSB method, where the least significant bits of image pixels are altered to embed hidden messages. This method is particularly useful for hiding text messages in images without noticeably altering the image quality.

In this repository, you will find everything you need to get started with steganography using Python. The code is structured for clarity and ease of modification, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Features

- **LSB Steganography**: Embed and extract messages within PNG images using the Least Significant Bit method.
- **Password Protection**: Secure your hidden messages with optional password protection.
- **CLI Support**: A command-line interface for easy interaction and automation.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/julio9410/CyberSecurity-Steganography.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CyberSecurity-Steganography
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   You can now run the application directly from the command line.

## Usage

To use the steganography tool, follow the steps below:

1. **Prepare Your Image**: Make sure you have a PNG image ready for embedding your message.

2. **Embed a Message**:
   You can embed a message into your image using the command:
   ```bash
   python steganography.py embed -i input_image.png -o output_image.png -m "Your secret message" -p "your_password"
   ```

3. **Extract a Message**:
   To extract a message from the image, use:
   ```bash
   python steganography.py extract -i output_image.png -p "your_password"
   ```

## Command-Line Interface

The CLI is designed for simplicity. Here are the available commands:

- `embed`: Embeds a message into an image.
- `extract`: Extracts a hidden message from an image.

### Command Options

| Command   | Description                       | Options                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| embed     | Embed a message into an image     | `-i`, `-o`, `-m`, `-p`               |
| extract   | Extract a message from an image    | `-i`, `-p`                           |

## Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example to demonstrate how to use the tool:

1. **Embed a Message**:
   ```bash
   python steganography.py embed -i example.png -o hidden_image.png -m "Hello, World!" -p "mysecret"
   ```

2. **Extract the Message**:
   ```bash
   python steganography.py extract -i hidden_image.png -p "mysecret"
   ```

After running the extract command, you should see "Hello, World!" printed in the console.
